            <h2>The Life Story of One Tyler Warren</h2>
            <p>
                Oh, where to begin? I suppose my earliest memory is as good as any (though probably not, as early memories are hazy and easily altered). I think I remember my third birthday. There was this gigantic cake shaped like a teddy bear with frosting that was the purest of browns. On my left, my kind, gracious father, and on my right my grandfather. My mother was force-feeding my sister her first slice of cake at the end of the table. Other people were there, too, but I don&rsquo;t remember who. That&rsquo;s a pretty solid memory, if you ask me. At least it was, until two years ago when my mother was cleaning the house and found the teddy-bear-shaped cake pan that formed my most perfect of third birthday cakes. It was no bigger than one of my size 13 flip-flops, though I remember it being as big as my three-year-old body. Then my mom pulled out some pictures, and I discovered that the cake was not only small, but a grotesque grey color as well. I felt cheated out of my first memory. Anyway, the point of this story is that memories are fallible and heavily conditional, but I will continue to tell my life through a series of anecdotal memories despite these facts.
            </p>
            <p>
                My sister, lovely person though she is, would continue to be a nuisance to my young, burgeoning mind (but I'm sure I hampered her exploits as well). I learned to read quickly, but was such an unstructured learner that my parents thought it best to keep me home-schooled at first. This was back in the early 2000s, so desktops were still a thing. The desktop that my sister and I shared was kept her room (as to why, I may never know - she never even used it!). One fateful day, I was using this behemoth for significant, impactful research on <!-- buttermeup --> <a style="color: black; text-decoration: none;" href="mc">K</a>id Pix while my sister played with her Barbies on the floor. She was an imaginative child same as I, so of course Grandma Barbie was telekinetic and flew around the room like an osprey in heat (sound included). This was, of course, maddening to a blossoming researcher such as myself. I informed Grandma Barbie that she was to cease her life of incessant flying (in my face) and turn her skillset towards other, more useful deeds like bending silverware or hands-free toilet flushing. Stubborn as ever, Grandma Barbie delivered her retort straight to my face. The next thing she remembers is waking up with no head. Grandma Barbie being the prize of the family collection, my sister naturally burst into intemperate streams of tears. My parents then banished me to the outdoors, where I rode my bike around the house repeatedly, making up songs to sing to myself.

                It was at this time that I became obsessed with the natural world. I went to the local library and checked out every book they had on dinosaurs. I woke up late at night to watch meteor showers with my dad. I spent hours of my weekends watching carpenter ants carry meaty bits down their little ant trail to the nest in a tree in our front yard. I stayed up late at night helping my dad murder all the carpenter ants with death spray. I even took the other kids at school (oh yeah, I&rsquo;m going to school now) out back to teach them the names of insects and arachnids. They didn&rsquo;t give a shit, but my teacher did. In my yearbook she wrote &ldquo;thanks for teaching the other kids stuff&rdquo; or something like that. It was a really small school (read: 15 total), but the asshole count was unproportionally high. A girl hit me one day. I responded in kind, because my grandpa told me to live by the Golden Rule. That day I learned a lesson straight from the Book of Virtues: life isn&rsquo;t fair, and nobody really gets stitches. I did learn how to <strike>make friends</strike> get along with assholes, however. I also learned a lot of other things, too, and I don&rsquo;t mean times tables. The &lsquo;boys&rsquo; had this tree in the back lot where we would spend recess. It was small, but it had just enough seats to function as the perfect conference tree for our posse. It was there we would play the ever popular car-calling game, and it was there I learned that sexual intercourse is defined as phallus to anus interaction. I also learned that a virgin is someone who has never had the pleasure of experiencing wedlock (we&rsquo;re talking the wedding here, not the consummation). It was also there that I became a legend. One day, our prized timber was overrun with tiny, black and red invaders. One boy screamed &ldquo;spiders, spiders!&rdquo; But I, ever the impeccable naturalist, knew the truth. These were the larvae of a species of assassin bug, and they spit acid at their attackers. Well, that&rsquo;s not actually true - it&rsquo;s just what I told the other kids. Since I had glasses to defend my self from their astringent spray and knew their one weakness, I was nominated to seek and destroy these cursed trespassers. This weakness was water. Armed with a spray bottle, I re-conquered our tree in the name of all things holy. All my triumphs were for naught; the next day one of the boys called me four-eyes, which stung worse than any hornet.

                Luckily, the next chapter in my life had an abrupt beginning: my family moved to the Great Desert. Naturally, that not only meant a new location, but also a new school and new friends. My fourth grade class consisted of four boys including myself and an entourage of girls. Some of the male persuasion would consider this a kind of heaven, but not I - at least not at the time. Girls were gross, plain and simple. Unfortunately, this left me with only three friend choices. One of these was the universally-hated stinky kid, who was undoubtedly right out. Only two choices left: Douglas and John (this is probably a good time to note that all of the names in this story have been changed because I don&rsquo;t want my house burned down). Now Douglas and John had been the only boys in the class since kindergarten, and they were inseparable. John and I clicked pretty well, but Douglas hated my guts. He was convinced that I would steal John out from under his nose, leaving only the stinky kid for a playmate. He did what all bullies do: publicly embarrassed me and privately harassed me. Regrettably, I was unprepared for bullying, as my aforementioned skillset consisted of a database of fish species and fossilization methods rather than a database of karate moves or witty comebacks. After a year of this treatment, I stopped haphazardly fighting back, and Douglas&rsquo;s worst fear was realized. I began to draw cartoons with John. These cartoons consumed nearly all of John&rsquo;s time; time he spent with me. Pretty soon, these cartoons were all the rage, and everyone wanted a personalized paper. Only later did I learn that poor Douglas was subject to a divorce and an alcoholic father. He bullied me because he was afraid of losing the only thing that made him happy, but ultimately his actions were the cause of his loss. Let this be a lesson to all: aggression is not the answer - unless you are up against a conservative review board, but that comes later.
            </p>
            <p>
                My elementary school had a recreational skiing program. I was not athletic in any way and had never retained the desire to change that. On the other hand, almost everyone else in my class loved to ski or snowboard and would head off to the mountain all day, every Friday. I was left alone with the scant few remnants of my class and a bunch of upper-graders. Providentially, the lack of pupils allowed the vestigial remainder a day of recess. The entire day was spent outdoors on the playground or inside playing board games if the weather ran afoul. During these canicular days, I befriended Michael. I had recently discovered the wonders of pulp cinema, and Michael shared my enthusiasm. Each Friday we would storm the playground, enacting action sequences from unreleased sequels to our favorite pictorial properties. Our best-loved franchise was Indiana Jones. I would don Michael&rsquo;s fedora and my satchel-like lunchbox, and Michael would portray all of the other characters our scenes called for: multi-ethnic sidekicks, despicable baddies, damsels in distress. One Friday, Michael asked to don the fedora and lunchbox. I instinctively refused; <u>I</u> was Indiana Jones. That was that. Michael then asked that I return his fedora and called me a dillhole. I had no idea what a dillhole was, but it sounded pretty crummy. I assumed our friendship to be over. This was the first friend I had truly lost, and I decided that I should learn to ski.
            </p>
            <p>
                Learn to ski I did. I worked my way up the snow-encrusted ladder - rope tow, bunny hill, more bunny hill, lots and lots of bunny hill. After a couple years on the bunny hill, I was finally ready for a quad chairlift to bigger and better snow. I prided myself in my ability to fall without getting hurt and would often brag about it to other kids in the lodge. However, fate was not on my side that fateful day. I rode up the chairlift like everyone else, dismounted perfectly, and began to descend. I stuck to greens, but alas, I came to a blue run with no way to go around. I took in a deep, icy breath and remembered my training. It had all been leading up to this moment. I opened my eyes, ready to descend, but I was already on the ground. After all the hype, I had fallen over in place and twisted my ankle to boot. Later, in the lodge, I was complaining about my frigid trauma when some brat called me a weasel. I wish, dear readers, that I could say I stood despite my twisted extremity and mauled the bastard. Alas, I merely looked at him with disdain. What a missed opportunity that was. At the end of the day, I learned that skiing really wasn&rsquo;t all it was aggrandized to be. Despite this, skiing would later provide me with my first girlfriend, but that also comes later. Before we get to that point, we should talk about my first crush.
            </p>
            <p>
                My first crush was a nice girl named Mary. Well, I should be honest. Everyone else had crushes at the time, and I was going through a little hormonal imbalance called puberty. I concluded that I must have a crush to be normal and convinced myself that Mary was the girl. Of course, like with most crush stories, I mistakenly trusted a rat bastard who let the whole goddamn world know the fabricated truth. Later that day, I saw Mary in tears, but I guess I&rsquo;ll never know if they were caused by me because I didn&rsquo;t ask. Needless to say, Mary had a birthday like most normal human beings, and being the kind person she was, she invited me to the party. I did what any crushing fool would do and showed up. By some nasty trick, I was the only male from my class to make an appearance. All the girls were there though, and I was forced to talk to them. They indubitably wanted me to ask Mary out (which was a highly foreign concept to dinosaur-loving me). I had managed to avoid Mary for most of the party when fate laughed at me once more. I was sitting happily on Mary&rsquo;s back porch, minding my own goddamn business, when Mary&rsquo;s little jackanapes of a cousin pushed me off of it. I landed on my arm, fracturing my left humerus dangerously close to the growth plate. I may have broken my humerus, but the situation was far from humorous. After screaming in pain like a petite cherub, I succeeded in passing out in the arms of none other than Mary herself. We did not live happily ever after in her villa by the sea. I was rushed to the hospital, never to be seen in her arms again.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now for a bit of a flashback: up until this point, my elementary school had had an excellent music program shepherded by the lovely Mrs. Collins. She had taught us basic music theory, led us in rousing choral numbers, and bought us all recorders so that we could jam to Hot Cross Buns. Sadly, she returned to graduate school and was replaced by the horrid Mrs. Lemon, who doubled as our PE teacher. Mrs. Lemon had dropped out of army boot camp, but she still retained that delightful army discipline in all aspects of her life. In PE, we not only did butterfly kicks, but also ran around town in formation singing &ldquo;Left. Left. Left Right Left.&rdquo; Her hostile takeover of the music program began as a steady coup, but it quickly destabilized into militaristic anarchy. She replaced the recorders, claves, and boomwhackers with guitar, drums, and brite electric pianos. Music club (something I was an active member of) became band, but we sounded far from cohesive. The guitars, drums, and piano all hit in slight but bellicose unison while the vocalists sang an off-tune dirge. Many of the instrumentalists were so musically uncoordinated that they would appear to enter a state of ataxia while a myriad of unpleasant sounds erupted forth from their respective instrument. It was in the midst of this bedlam that fate spit in my face once more. I, probably being the most musically talented in my class after several years of piano lessons, became accustomed to playing multiple instruments during a single song to fill parts that no one else could. It was the average Wednesday pandemonium as I ran from playing the cajon to sing harmony during the chorus when I tripped on a stray microphone cord. Having recently fractured my humerus in the most unhumorous of situations, I had been advised not to allow my heavy cast to collide viciously with any surface. At this occasion, my cast collided viciously with the ground. The chaos abruptly ended as I screamed &ldquo;Not again! Not again! No please God, not again.&rdquo; I had not re-fractured my arm, but I had certainly ended all chances of dating any woman in the room.

                I did have other exploits besides failing in front of my peers. I also failed in front of large audiences. My school was like any other grade school and participated in national competitions like the geography bee, the math bee, and the spelling bee. I participated in all three (which is more than I can say for the others in my class), but I rarely achieved much more than participant. I did, however, advance past the state level in the Spelling Bee and make it to regionals in seventh grade by the skin of my teeth. To spare you readers the minutiae of the competition, let&rsquo;s just say I ended up in the final round of the state level. I got up to spell my first word, beagle, and blurted out b-a-g-l-e. Lucky for me, it was only the practice round, but the rest of the spellers had nonetheless marked me as chum. I managed to slide into fourth place (the top four went to regionals), and this girl from Mesilla Valley (our rival school) came in first. She was awfully proud of herself, but I was just happy to go at all. The regional competition is still probably the most stressful and nerve-wracking moment of my life. Here I was, woefully underprepared against a brigade of talented spellers with hours of practice in their back pockets and in front of a massive crowd of parents, teachers, and other raving lunatics. I wasn&rsquo;t the only nervous wreck, however. One kid leaned forward and put his head between his knees the entire competition. Another kid took what I swear was 10 minutes to spell every word, no matter the length. The Mesilla Valley girl rooted for other people to frivol and die. Unbeknownst to me, she had her mark on my forehead right from the start. Every word I spelled correctly, her smug look worsened. She was in my row and had to pass me to sit down after spelling a word. During one such occasion, she kicked me in the shin as she went by. I had no idea that I deserved such treatment, but after that moment <u>my</u> mark was on <i>her</i>. Finally, she met her demise at the word quodlibet, which she spelled q-u-a-d-l-i-b-e-t. In a complete stroke of poetic justice, it was a word I had studied profusely and knew inside out. Her parents contested the judges, and lost to her great bereavement. I later went out on the word embodiment, but it didn&rsquo;t matter. I crushed the girl from Mesilla Valley.

                I also tried my hand in the sports arena, but failed even more immensely. In eighth grade I participated in both track and cross country. I came in last place every time, but it was still fun because I could hang out with John. There was a downside, however: Alan. Alan was a giant asshat and the reason I was suspended for the only time in my life (he and I got into a heated fist fight, and I left the premises and walked to my dad&rsquo;s office building). He was much faster than me on a regular basis, but he was also lazy. One race in cross country, I was running my usual slow and steady. I could see Alan up ahead of me, and I became determined to catch him. He was slothfully trudging along, and I was slowly gaining on him. Right as I was within arm&rsquo;s reach, our coach called out from the sidelines &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve almost got him, Tyler!&rdquo; Alan, realizing his name was not Tyler, turned and saw me. Because he had not expended any real energy throughout the race due to his legendary lethargy, and because he was a complete asshat, he sprinted with everything he was worth to the finish line. I was unable to catch him, and from that moment forward, I vowed to never let one of my pissing contests be decided by a show of physical ability.

                After graduating from the social roadkill that was grade school, I sauntered off to the social and educational roadkill that was high school. My loving parents loved me so much that they sent me off to boarding school. This was not just any boarding school. It was a Conservative Christian boarding school. This is not to say that I have anything against Conservative Christians; most of them are lovely people and many of them good friends. But you readers must understand: this school was a prison where the inmates believe it's heaven. In accordance with the teachings of the Prophet, students are not allowed to wear jewelry, drink caffeinated beverages, play poker, eat meat, go to a movie theatre, ride bicycles, wear hats indoors, or hug for more than three seconds. Students are also required to attend a religious meeting every night, on top of bible classes and prayers 24/7. To tie it all up with a neat little bow, the principal was a two-faced son of a gun who only cared for the school&rsquo;s appearance with the Christian community. That being said, my first few years were quite enjoyable because of the friends I made there. Also, many of the kids went straight from homeschooling their entire lives to living alongside dozens of peers their age, providing me with countless unique stories. It was the first week in the dorm. I lived on freshman hall with the rest of the freshmen. Some of our number were Hispanic and received a care package loaded with traditional foods such as tortillas, tomatillos, spices, and serrano peppers. One of the many socially inept members of our class, Tom (though he is better known by his last name, Farley), thought the cool thing to do was brag about his spice-resistant prowess. He was, of course, challenged and offered $2 to eat one serrano pepper. He nonchalantly accepted, grabbed a pepper, and chowed down. For a few brief moments, his face was calm. He even began to say &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t that bad.&rdquo; But, before he could finish, his countenance changed. The next line of his gloat became &ldquo;Gimmemytwodollars!&rdquo; as he was laughed from the room. We later went to check on him and found him in his room with his face in the sink, mouth open and the faucet running full blast. This really is the first story in a long line of ridiculous shit that quickly became Farley&rsquo;s calling card.

                I started to get pretty involved at the Academy. I joined the choir and the drama club. I really enjoyed acting; it felt like an outlet for the cinematic aspirations of my youth. That is, until fate took a shit on my lap. It was grandparent weekend, and my grandparents had come from the other side of the state to see me perform in a play chronicling the history of the early Christian church. Naturally, this entailed heavy makeup including a prosthetic beard, and a costume consisting of two shirts, a vest, and an overcoat complete with coattails. I also had a top hat. Standing onstage the night of the performance, I started to feel hot. I had worked hard to memorize my lines, but they just weren&rsquo;t coming out properly or convincingly. I finished my portion, and stepped back to wait for my next line while the Prophet stepped forward to delivered hers. The spotlight was directly on me, and I locked my knees. I started running through my lines in my head over and over. Oddly, the Prophet started to feel farther and farther away, and her voice got more muffled and distant. Finally, I got tunnel vision and woke up on the ground. The play continued despite my passing out. Once it finished, the school nurse ran up to the stage to ensure I was OK. I didn&rsquo;t get a concussion or anything, but I did learn that I have a slower heartbeat than the average population and that theatre was not for me.

                Around this time, I changed roommates. Before the year had even started, I was assigned to a wonderful roommate named Dave. He and I got along well, but I decided to move in with my newfound best friend Rick. A bit of advice (also foreshadowing): never room with a best friend. I still needed an outlet for my motion picture urges, and Our Cool Webshow was born (and yes, Our Cool Webshow was the actual name). According to classmates, Rick and I were amusing when together. I had a camera. I thought to myself: <i>we should record ourselves doing stuff and make it available on Facebook. It&rsquo;ll be an extension to our Foolishness Feed</i> (because Facebook was all the rage in those days, Rick, a couple other friends, and I had made a page called Foolishness Feed dedicated to producing foolishness for the average consumer). We started out by making vlogs chronicling our ridiculous late-night escapades, the most notorious of which including microwaving a spare sock. Accompanied by dreams of Internet-wide fandom, OCW morphed into something more: a collection of droll parody videos that enveloped our small high school campus with laughter and merriment. Seriously, we were all the rage. We started picking up additional members: Chuck, a sophomore with fantastic acting skills and a side of moral support, James, a soft-spoken but hilarious freshman who would later become the backbone of the group, and Garth, a universal funnyman and coder who would later become my (for real) best friend. I was the motivation and drive of the group, forcing us to produce quality content weekly in a show of creativity I have never been able to replicate since. Garth coded us a website with links to our videos (not on YouTube, for it was blocked on our school-issued laptops) so that students and staff alike could enjoy our media production. Chuck worked on scripts with Rick and I; James would utter perfectly-timed witty remarks. I borrowed my dad&rsquo;s tripod indefinitely and dedicated it entirely to production. Students across grades (yes, even seniors) begged us to guest star, and several freshman girls began feeble attempts at replicating our success with an all-female cast. Somehow, we even gained traction with the staff. The IT guy made sure our website stayed on the whitelist, and the deans gave us special filming privileges during non-curfew hours. But alas, all good things must come to end. Rick was not asked to the banquet by his one true love, affecting him deeply. One night, I was sick with the plague and lying in my bed incapacitated. I asked Rick to hand me my water bottle so I could whet my parched throat. Rick looked at me for a moment, then burst into fulmination. &ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m your slave! You call me stupid and you think I don&rsquo;t notice, but I do, Nemo!&rdquo; Anyway, the next morning Rick told me he was done with Our Cool Webshow. He thought he would deal the crushing blow, but we continued without him just as successfully. After we made a few videos entirely without him, he decided to guest star in small roles, but he never returned to full member status after his wretched betrayal.

                Rick didn&rsquo;t return to the Academy the next year, but all the other OCW members did. In fact, we returned full throttle with a new camera, new microphones, and a new sense of direction. We quickly produced our best feature yet (which also happened to be our least politically correct) and were introduced to scores of new, adoring fans. Things were looking up. We started work on a video with a hilarious script titled &ldquo;The Curse of the Paradoxical Sleep.&rdquo; It contained the most locations, effects, and cameos we had ever packed into a video, including a cameo from our RA and the new taskforce dean. It was also set to be our first video with Stephen, a possible replacement for Rick. However, fate changed its mind once again. Garth and I were taking a mind-numbingly dull computer class together. The teacher knew almost nothing about computers, and the assignments were utterly ridiculous. On top of that, both Garth and I were fairly computer literate (Garth much more so), and learning how to indent a paragraph on Microsoft Word was far beneath us. One day, I was called out of computer class and into the principal&rsquo;s office. On the way there, I asked if I was in trouble and was met with a resoundingly worrying yes. I sat in the office for what felt like half an hour. When the administration finally came to talk to me, I had prepared a mental list of every sin I had ever committed so when they finally told me why I was there, I probably had a completely stupid look of relief on my face. They asked if I had cheated in computer class. I said, &ldquo;Computer class? No way. I wish I had&rdquo; and uncomfortably laughed. It was eventually revealed that Garth had hacked into the drive where we stored our computer assignments, taken mine from my folder, and submitted them as his own. I had been left out of the loop, and Garth admitted that so I got away scot-free. Now in Garth&rsquo;s defense, computer was a skill-based class and should have had a challenge test like a math or basic language class. However, the teacher refused to update the test, forcing more talented students to suffer with the peasants. Due to my boredom, I misbehaved often in her class, but my assignments were always &lsquo;A&rsquo; material. At the end of the semester, I had finished them all and even extra credit on the side. I checked my grade on the last day of class and saw it was an &lsquo;A.&rsquo; When I received my report card, I nevertheless had a &lsquo;B&rsquo; due to missing last minute participation points. Mrs. Pilgarlic had the last laugh.

                Anyway, OCW disbanded completely after Garth left school, and consequently &ldquo;Curse of the Paradoxical Sleep&rdquo; remains unfinished to this day. Garth&rsquo;s absence hit me and two remaining members of OCW pretty hard, but Stephen started a &ldquo;Garth was an asshole after all&rdquo; bandwagon (Stephen and Garth were both talented with computers, so maybe he felt threatened or something). Unfortunately, Garth and I had made a long list of plans for our year together. One of our many projects was starting a film festival for the students of the Academy. I decided that I should carry on with it in the name of Garth, and carry on I did. I prepared posters, made announcements at student assemblies, amassed a panel of judges (including myself) and pulled all the necessary strings with the necessary administration. Despite my preparation and advertising campaign, the video turnout was gaunt. Only two videos were submitted. One was made by a couple of videography students named Billbob and Bubba (names chosen to stress their asininity), and the other was made by Chuck. I ended up helping Chuck with his submission extensively, despite telling myself not to get involved to sustain my judge impartiality. When the time came to judge submissions, I tried to stay as impartial as possible, but Chuck&rsquo;s video was just plain better. Chuck had written a clever Python-esque script and acted brilliantly. Billbob and Bubba&rsquo;s video was an exercise in human patience - an utter slog of jump cuts, shaky cam, and appalling dialogue and plotting. Either way, there was no winner because we had no prizes to give out. Instead we opted to hold a public screening of both videos. Before the videos screened, however, another development thickened the plot. It was banquet time of year once again, and the officers of ASB (Associated Student Body) were planning it. Allow me to interject: banquet was the Conservative Christian equivalent of a dance or prom - either girls or guys (depending on the banquet) would ask a date to eat a meal with them and accompany them to the following activity. Now this particular year, the nominated ASB officers were major procrastinators and had not started their banquet planning until the last possible minute. It was the week that ASB needed to announce the theme for the upcoming banquet. They wanted a clever and entertaining video to announce this theme during the all-student assembly, but they had a few problems. First, it was Tuesday, and assembly was on Wednesday right before lunch. Second, the video had to be authorized by the administrative council which met on Wednesday morning. This meant that their video had to be completed by 8:00 Wednesday morning. Just to add a bit more of a twist, they had originally wanted a space themed banquet, but they changed their minds at the last minute to a secret agent theme. This theme, like the video, needed to be sanctioned by administrative council on Wednesday morning. However, if the secret agent theme was not approved, they would have to revert to their already-approved space theme. This meant that they needed two videos by 8 a.m. on Wednesday, and it was 12 p.m. on Tuesday. Naturally, they approached me. For some reason, I agreed and spent the next twelve hours dodging homework to film and edit both videos. Now, perhaps in my sleep-deprived dementia, I had been subconsciously influenced by recent events, but the film business has never been known for much originality. After the Wednesday assembly screening of my secret agent video, I was approached by Billbob and Bubba in the cafeteria. They were livid, explaining to me that the entire idea behind my secret agent video had been stolen from them. In truth, our videos shared a common location: an off-campus warehouse full of the Academy&rsquo;s random accumulations - desks, lamps, a tractor, an old piano - a fledgling cinematographer&rsquo;s dream, really. It is also true that both sequences featured a teenage male tied to a chair, held captive for no explicable reason other than pretty warehouse scenery. The simple truth of my apparent plagiarism was that our video sequence required a man to be captured, and I had been interested in warehouse filmmaking after viewing the Boiling twins unveiled their video. Plus, my options were quite limited since the hours to my deadline were a fraction of theirs. What they were truly upset about was that my video had a school-wide showing, whereas theirs would show the following week to a miniscule audience at best (truth be told, most were there to see Chuck&rsquo;s video anyway). Luckily, they only complained to me and not administration, and nothing came of their public jeremiads. I did learn a valuable lesson: if you steal from someone, make sure they don&rsquo;t find out.
